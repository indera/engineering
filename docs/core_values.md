# Stratasan's Core Values

## Everybody makes the coffee

We help where help is needed. Whether we’re asked to pitch in on an important customer call, run a meeting at the last-minute, or make the morning coffee -- everybody does what’s necessary to keep the engine running.  We don’t believe in “pulling rank”.

## Honest conversations make us stronger

The toughest conversations, when approached with kindness and respect, yield the best outcomes for the business and the team. We don’t hide from tough conversations.

## Seek first to understand

We try to see other people’s perspective prior to sharing ours. We make a deliberate effort to see things from their point of view and refrain from judgment until we do. This goes for interaction with customers, colleagues, and prospects alike.

## Assume positive intent

We believe it’s important to start from the assumption that people are good and that the intent behind their action is positive. We believe this builds stronger and more trusting relationships.


## Punch above your weight class

We grow by doing things that challenge us.  We believe success favors the bold; we encourage our team to continually stretch their comfort zone. Good athletes become great by competing against those better than them.


## Our success is my success

We support one another, strive for the success of the team, and recognize nothing is done alone.


## Show Up. Don’t Quit.

Whatever we are doing at Stratasan, we must first consciously Show Up; and when things are difficult we must convince ourselves Don’t Quit.
