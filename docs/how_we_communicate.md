# How We Communicate

Most of our communication is over Slack. Given that we are a distributed team,
we work to communicate availability in a manner considerate to our teammates.

We also work to make sure that important decisions are well-documented. Chat is,
generally speaking, more ephemeral so most important developer conversations
should occur via email or GitHub comments.

### Slack Considerations

- We set up DnD outside of work hours, so generally if the need is urgent we
  communicate via text messages.
- If we are going to be
  [AFK](http://www.internetslang.com/AFK-meaning-definition.asp) for more than
  10-15 minutes, we let others know by communicating how long we expect to be
  gone and how to reach us in an emergency.

### Git and GitHub

- Good commit messages [matter](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Comments should @tag anyone whose response is required.
- When PRs are ready, they should be assigned to someone.
    - Assignment does not necessarily mean the assignee must review it, but
      rather the assignee should determine who is best qualified to review the
      PR and merge it.
    - ThoughtBot has a great description of [what a code review should consist
    of](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).
- PRs that are not complete are unassigned and generally have "[WIP]" in the
  title.
- We use [ZenHub](http://zenhub.io) for managing ticket priority.

### Meetings

We document any decisions that are made and actions that are required so that we
can share them with non-attendees.

### Work Hours

Our company's official business hours are from 8am to 5pm. However, in order to
reduce the amount of time in traffic some of our team shifts those hours around
(.g., from 7-4 or even 9-6). Team members should communicate their availability
with the rest of the company in order to alleviate any concerns about
scheduling.
